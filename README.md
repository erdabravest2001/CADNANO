## Purpose
To centralize our python code in one github repo. We also hope to share the Sandwich Checker and the Kinetic Trap Checker with Shawn Douglas, so we can possibly integrate the existing code with the current CADNANO GUI. 

## Documentation: 
To get our thought process behind our python files, please consult the following masterlog:
